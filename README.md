# Computer-Network-Simulation
This project simulates an enterprise network with EIGRP, OSPF, and RIP routing, VLAN segmentation, dynamic IP allocation, NAT, and security policies. Route redistribution connects different network segments, and DHCP servers assign IPs dynamically. The Packet Tracer topology visually represents a scalable and secure network setup.
